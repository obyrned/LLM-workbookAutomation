# Workbook Generator

The Comprehension Workbook Generator is a web application designed to transform novel text into educational materials. Using OpenAI's GPT-4o and the DeepSeek-R1:8B model, it generates comprehension questions and vocabulary exercises, making it easy to create workbooks for lessons.

## üìå Requirements

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Software**
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Streamlit**: Used for the interactive web-based interface.
- **python-dotenv**: Loads API keys from an environment file.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for vocabulary extraction.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ OpenAI API Key (Required)**
This script requires an **OpenAI API key** for processing vocabulary.  
If you don‚Äôt have one, create an API key at **[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)**.

#### **‚û§ How to Set Up Your API Key**
1. **Create a `.env` file** in the project directory.
2. **Add your OpenAI API key** inside `.env` (replace `sk-xxxx` with your key):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Ollama + DeepSeek Setup**
The script **previously** supported **DeepSeek via Ollama**, but this is currently **disabled**.  
If you want to use it, ensure **Ollama is installed and running** on port **11434**.

## üöÄ **How to Run**
1. **Start the Streamlit app**:
```bash
streamlit run vocab_workbook.py
```
2. **Upload a `.txt` file**, and the app will extract vocabulary words.

## üìÇ **Output Files**
- The extracted words will be saved in **`data/`** as:
  - **JSON**: `vocab10_<filename>.json`
  - **TXT**: `vocab10_<filename>.txt`

## üîó **Additional Notes**
- OpenAI API logs can be checked at [OpenAI API Logs](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-logs).
- If you encounter API errors, ensure your **API key is set correctly** in `.env`.
